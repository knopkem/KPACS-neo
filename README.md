# K-PACS.neo

A modern C# port of key components from **K-PACS**, the free DICOM workstation I originally wrote about 20 years ago. K-PACS was one of the first freely available DICOM viewers and became widely used in radiology departments, veterinary clinics, and research labs around the world.

This project aims to bring the core DICOM infrastructure into the .NET ecosystem, built on top of [fo-dicom](https://github.com/fo-dicom/fo-dicom) and targeting **.NET 10**.

The supported application shape in this repository is:

- **K-PACS Viewer (Avalonia)** — the main workstation, including local mode, local GPU/OpenCL mode, and an integrated remote-render / remote-imagebox option
- **K-PACS Render Server** — the companion headless service that provides remote rendering and remote study browsing for that integrated viewer mode

The old **WPF viewer has been retired from this repository**. Active UI development now happens only in the **Avalonia** application.

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed: DCMClasses Core Library

The entire **DCMClasses** package has been ported — this is the foundational DICOM data layer that everything else builds on. It covers:

- **DICOM parsing & serialization** — reading/writing DICOM files, tag manipulation, sequence navigation, character set support
- **DICOM networking** — full async C-ECHO, C-FIND (Patient/Study/Series/Image level), C-MOVE, C-STORE SCU, and Modality Worklist queries
- **Image objects** — pixel data access, frame extraction, transfer syntax handling, compression/decompression
- **Specialized SOP classes** — Secondary Capture, Encapsulated PDF, Structured Reports, Presentation State (GSPS with annotations, windowing, spatial transforms)
- **DICOMDIR** — creation and reading of media directory structures
- **Utility functions** — UID generation, date/time conversions, patient name parsing, age calculation

### ✅ Completed: Avalonia Study Browser + Viewer (Cross-Platform)

The Avalonia application has moved beyond a single-file viewer and now includes a working **K-PACS-style local study browser** on top of the cross-platform viewer:

- **Database mode** backed by a local SQLite imagebox
- **Filesystem mode** with Windows-style `Computer` root, drive browsing, folder scan, and optional DICOMDIR usage
- **Network mode** with configured remote archive search, preview of remote series, and representative-image-first retrieval into the local imagebox
- **Preview-before-import workflow**: filesystem scans build preview studies first, and opening a study can copy it into the local imagebox in the background while it is already viewable
- **Study actions**: view, send to remote archive, pseudonymize, and delete study (including multi-select send/delete for local studies)
- **Background job monitor** for import/send tasks with progress, per-job logs, and optional DICOM communication trace inspection
- **Multi-window study viewing** with configurable 1-4 viewer windows, persisted placement per viewer, cross-window linked navigation, and a safety-first clear-all-open-viewers flow before opening a new study
- **Multi-viewport study viewer** with thumbnail strip, standard and custom layouts, double-click single-view focus toggle, LUT switching, stack-tool drag behavior, direct active-viewport selection, drag-reassignable series layouting, and cross-window series drag/drop with a floating drag preview that stays visible across viewer boundaries
- **Patient-history comparison workflow** with automatic prior assignment to additional viewer windows, patient-level double-click loading across local repository plus remote archive results, and newest-to-oldest study distribution across comparison viewers/history
- **Interactive orientation/navigation overlays** including patient left/right markers and a live 3D cursor for cross-view localization within the same viewer or across open viewers, available via `Shift` or the viewport toolbox and now also working with topograms/localizers that share the same frame of reference
- **Expanded measurement toolkit** including pixel lens, line, angle, annotation, rectangle ROI, ellipse ROI, polygon ROI, erase, and modify/nudge workflows, all anchored to the referenced slice geometry in patient space
- **ROI analytics panel** with floating histogram/distribution details, draggable labels, pin/collapse persistence, and modality-aware statistics such as CT HU summaries, MR intensity summaries, and slice-level radiomics-style percentiles and spread metrics
- **Semi-automatic ROI outlining** for polygon and volumetric ROI workflows via double-click seed detection, followed by interactive grow/shrink sensitivity correction for fast lesion cleanup
- **True multi-slice 3D ROI workflow** with slice-to-slice contour drafting, interpolation between source slices, rotatable mesh preview, persistent/pinnable 3D model panel, and additive multi-component capture so disconnected structures can remain separate within one saved ROI model
- **Research measurement workflow** with viewport-accessible `Suggest RECIST follow-up`, patient-space lesion tracking metadata, slice radiomics extraction for ROI measurements, and archiveable research SR export with scene-state payload support
- **Volume-aware series viewing** for real volumetric CT/MR stacks with cached in-memory voxel volumes, axial/coronal/sagittal reslicing, and slab projection modes
- **In-panel volume interaction badges** shown only for true volume datasets: orientation switching, projection-mode switching, and drag-adjustable slab thickness in mm
- **Floating 3D rendering workspace** with per-viewport projection mode selection, DVR transfer presets, shading presets, light-direction presets, and viewer-wide medical color maps
- **Direct volume rendering (DVR)** with CPU ray casting, progressive fast/sharp rerendering, orbit interaction, and preset-driven shading/light behavior
- **Oblique tilt-plane navigation** via a dedicated toolbox tool that tilts the current slice/slab plane in all volume modes, including DVR, while wheel and middle-drag continue front-to-back scrolling through the volume
- **Parallelized volume reslicing/projection** for oblique slabs and thick orthogonal slabs to improve interactive performance on multi-core CPUs
- **Linked slice synchronization** for same-space series plus lightweight prior-study / CT-MR fallback registration based on cached voxel volumes
- **Integrated remote rendering mode** at the study-browser level with persisted render-server endpoint settings, remote imagebox browsing, transparent study open flow, and server-side rendering for both thin 2D series and full volume datasets
- **Key-image workflow** with K-PACS-root Secondary Capture generation, volume-mode key-image toggling, and preview-strip marking only for K-PACS-managed key-image series
- **DICOM rendering coverage** including bitmap overlay planes (60xx), embedded overlay bits, RGB Secondary Capture, and multiple YBR photometric interpretations
- **Search/filter support** in Database, Filesystem, and Network mode, including wildcard remote matching and safe blocking of empty remote queries
- **Local Storage SCP receiving** backed by fo-dicom with automatic import into the local imagebox
- **Operational polish** including toast notifications, persisted browser/viewer window placement, persisted study browser splitters, and non-modal viewer windows
- Shares the same platform-independent rendering engine and color LUTs across the current C# viewer stack
- Uses Avalonia pointer events, StorageProvider dialogs, and Semi.Avalonia styling

## Building

```bash
# Core library
dotnet build KPACS.DCMClasses/KPACS.DCMClasses.csproj

# Cross-platform Avalonia viewer
dotnet build KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia/KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia.csproj

# Remote render server
dotnet build KPACS.RenderServer/KPACS.RenderServer.csproj
```

## Release Packaging

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow at [.github/workflows/release-packages.yml](.github/workflows/release-packages.yml) that builds four native self-contained release artifacts for the Avalonia viewer:

- `win-x64` — single-file `.exe` packed as `.zip`
- `linux-x64` — single-file executable packed as `.tar.gz`
- `osx-x64` — zipped `KPACS-neo.app` bundle for Intel Macs
- `osx-arm64` — zipped `KPACS-neo.app` bundle for Apple Silicon Macs

These release builds use:

- self-contained .NET 10 runtime
- single-file publish
- embedded native libraries via self-extraction
- release symbols disabled for smaller artifacts
- bundled neuro anatomy pack in `anatomy-packs/cranium-base.sample.json`

### Local publish commands

These are the exact publish settings used for release packaging:

```bash
dotnet publish KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia/KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:EnableCompressionInSingleFile=true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true -p:DebugType=None -p:DebugSymbols=false

dotnet publish KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia/KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia.csproj -c Release -r linux-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:EnableCompressionInSingleFile=true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true -p:DebugType=None -p:DebugSymbols=false

dotnet publish KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia/KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia.csproj -c Release -r osx-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:EnableCompressionInSingleFile=true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true -p:DebugType=None -p:DebugSymbols=false

dotnet publish KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia/KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia.csproj -c Release -r osx-arm64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:EnableCompressionInSingleFile=true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true -p:DebugType=None -p:DebugSymbols=false
```

### GitHub Release flow

- Create a tag such as `0.5.0`
- Publish a GitHub Release for that tag
- The workflow builds all three platform packages on native runners and attaches them to the release automatically

You can also run the workflow manually with `workflow_dispatch` to generate test artifacts without publishing a release.

### macOS note

The macOS package is emitted as an unsigned `.app` bundle. That is the most practical first-release shape for “download, unpack, start”, but Gatekeeper may still require the user to right-click the app and choose `Open` once unless the app is later code signed and notarized.

## Running

```bash
# Avalonia viewer (any platform)
dotnet run --project KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia/KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia.csproj

# Render server
dotnet run --project KPACS.RenderServer/KPACS.RenderServer.csproj
```

## Avalonia Browser Workflow

The Avalonia application now supports a practical local-plus-network K-PACS workflow:

- **Database** — studies already imported into the local SQLite imagebox
- **Filesystem** — browse drives/folders, scan DICOM folders or DICOMDIR media, preview studies, then import on demand
- **Filesystem** — browse drives/folders, scan DICOM folders or DICOMDIR media, preview studies, open them immediately, and let the local copy continue in the background
- **Network** — configure one primary remote archive, query studies, preview remote series, and open studies with progressive background retrieval into the local imagebox
- **Email** — placeholder tab for future mail/export workflows

### Local imagebox

The Avalonia application stores imported studies under the current user's local application data folder:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%/KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia/Imagebox
```

This contains:

- `imagebox.db` — SQLite metadata database
- `Studies/` — imported DICOM files organized by Study Instance UID / Series Instance UID

Additional runtime configuration files are stored alongside the imagebox root:

- `network-settings.json` — local AE title/port plus the configured remote archive
- `window-placement.json` — persisted browser/viewer geometry
- `study-browser-layout.json` — persisted patient/study and study/series splitter sizes
- `job-logs/` — per-job import/send logs written by the background job service

### Remote rendering mode

The Avalonia viewer can also connect to a `KPACS.RenderServer` instance and use the same study-browser workflow against the server-side imagebox:

- **Standalone CPU / local mode** — browser and viewer use the workstation's own imagebox and CPU rendering path
- **Standalone local GPU/OpenCL mode** — browser stays local while volume rendering uses local OpenCL when available
- **Remote render-server mode** — the browser can switch to the remote imagebox, and opened studies render through the server while preserving the normal K-PACS viewer workflow

This remote mode is built into `KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia`; there is no separate thin-client application in the supported repository layout.

### Network workflow notes

- Double-clicking a network study loads remote series metadata first, then opens the viewer as soon as the first representative images arrive.
- Remaining series continue downloading in the background through the configured local Storage SCP.
- Local studies can be sent back to the configured archive with the `Send` action in Database mode.
- Empty network searches are blocked on purpose to avoid accidental full-archive C-FIND requests.

### Volume viewing notes

- Volume controls are shown only when a series could be promoted to a true in-memory volume; 2D datasets such as plain radiography, angiography, or ultrasound continue to use the legacy single-slice viewer path.
- The viewer loads the initial series through the existing file-based path first and upgrades matching series to cached voxel volumes in the background.
- The orientation badge inside the view panel switches between Axial, Coronal, and Sagittal.
- The projection badge inside the view panel switches between MPR, MipPR, MinPR, MPVRT, and DVR.
- Dragging on the projection badge changes slab thickness in millimeters; holding Shift while dragging enables finer adjustment.
- The viewport toolbox now includes a `Tilt plane` tool for oblique slice/slab navigation; left drag tilts the plane, while mouse wheel and middle-drag still move the tilted plane front-to-back through the dataset.
- Oblique plane rendering shares the same patient-space slice model across MPR, MIP, MinIP, MPVRT, and DVR, so tilted navigation stays spatially consistent across all volume modes.
- The 3D Rendering workspace exposes transfer-function presets such as Bone, Soft Tissue, Lung, Vascular Red, Skin Surface, Endoscopy, PET Hot Iron, PET Spectrum, and Perfusion, plus matching shading and light-direction presets.
- Available medical color maps now include Grayscale, Inverted, Hot Iron, PET, Rainbow, Spectrum, Gold, Bone, Jet, BlackBody, and Flow.
- Linked navigation continues to use exact patient-space matching for compatible series and can fall back to a lightweight translation-only volume registration for prior studies or cross-modality comparisons when both sides have volumes.
- Open viewer windows for the same patient can broadcast linked navigation and Shift-based 3D cursor updates across monitors.

### Research workflow notes

- Use the viewport toolbox or the measurement popup action `Suggest RECIST follow-up` after selecting a baseline line or ROI measurement.
- RECIST suggestions use the selected baseline measurement as the source lesion and the active or toolbox-target viewport as the follow-up target series.
- Suggested follow-up measurements retain tracking metadata such as label, timepoint, confidence summary, and patient-space lesion center.
- ROI-based measurements can also feed slice radiomics extraction and research SR export payloads for downstream review or archival.

### ROI workflow notes

- Rectangle, ellipse, and polygon ROIs now expose richer per-slice measurement summaries, including mean, median, standard deviation, percentile bands, min/max, and physical area.
- Selecting an ROI opens a floating histogram/details panel with draggable positioning, pinning, collapse/expand support, and modality-specific supplemental hints such as CT attenuation language or MR/DWI context.
- Polygon ROI supports double-click auto-outline when no line has been started; use the ROI panel `Shrink` and `Grow` actions to tune the segmentation sensitivity after creation.
- The `Modify` tool supports keyboard nudging of the selected measurement with the arrow keys; hold `Shift` for larger steps.

### 3D ROI workflow notes

- Choose `3D ROI` from the viewport toolbox to draft a volumetric ROI across slices; double-click without a line to auto-outline the pointed structure, or double-click with a line already started to close the current contour.
- The floating 3D ROI panel shows a rotatable mesh preview, estimated volume, and source/interpolated contours; use the arrow keys to rotate the preview and `Enter` / `Esc` to finish or cancel the draft.
- `Shrink` and `Grow` re-run the latest auto-outline with lower or higher sensitivity while preserving the current preview orientation.
- `Add` appends another disconnected component into the same 3D ROI draft instead of replacing the existing structure, which is useful for paired anatomy such as left/right ventricles or bilateral lesions.
- Saved 3D ROI measurements continue to show interpolated contours during slice navigation while keeping source slices visually distinguishable from generated intermediate slices.

### Viewer interaction notes

- The layout popup supports both standard grids and custom row-based layouts such as `2:3` or `1,2`.
- Double-clicking a viewport toggles between the current layout and a focused single-view mode.
- Key-image preview badges are reserved for K-PACS-managed Secondary Capture series generated under the K-PACS UID root.
- Bitmap overlays from 60xx groups are rendered directly in the panel, with fallback extraction from embedded overlay bits when needed.

### Remote DICOM archive configuration examples

The Avalonia browser currently stores network configuration in `network-settings.json` under `%LOCALAPPDATA%/KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia`.

Example structure:

```json
{
    "LocalAeTitle": "KPACS",
    "LocalPort": 11112,
    "InboxDirectory": "C:\\Users\\<you>\\AppData\\Local\\KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia\\network-inbox",
    "SelectedArchiveId": "conquest-local",
    "Archives": [
        {
            "Id": "conquest-local",
            "Name": "Local Conquest",
            "Host": "127.0.0.1",
            "Port": 5678,
            "RemoteAeTitle": "CONQUESTSRV1"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Conquest PACS example

Use this when Conquest is running locally or on a reachable server and accepts query/retrieve on its configured TCP port.

```json
{
    "LocalAeTitle": "KPACS",
    "LocalPort": 11112,
    "InboxDirectory": "C:\\Users\\<you>\\AppData\\Local\\KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia\\network-inbox",
    "SelectedArchiveId": "conquest-main",
    "Archives": [
        {
            "Id": "conquest-main",
            "Name": "Conquest Main",
            "Host": "192.168.1.50",
            "Port": 5678,
            "RemoteAeTitle": "CONQUESTSRV1"
        }
    ]
}
```

Typical Conquest pairing:

- Local Storage SCP in K-PACS: AE `KPACS`, port `11112`
- Remote archive in K-PACS: host `192.168.1.50`, port `5678`, remote AE `CONQUESTSRV1`
- Matching destination configured in Conquest for C-MOVE/C-STORE back to K-PACS: AE `KPACS` at your workstation IP and port `11112`

#### Orthanc example

Orthanc often uses AE title `ORTHANC` and DICOM port `4242` unless changed in its configuration.

```json
{
    "LocalAeTitle": "KPACS",
    "LocalPort": 11112,
    "InboxDirectory": "C:\\Users\\<you>\\AppData\\Local\\KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia\\network-inbox",
    "SelectedArchiveId": "orthanc-dev",
    "Archives": [
        {
            "Id": "orthanc-dev",
            "Name": "Orthanc Dev",
            "Host": "127.0.0.1",
            "Port": 4242,
            "RemoteAeTitle": "ORTHANC"
        }
    ]
}
```

Checklist for any remote PACS:

- The remote PACS must know the workstation as destination AE `KPACS` on port `11112` (or whatever you configure locally).
- Firewalls must allow inbound traffic to the local Storage SCP port.
- AE titles must match exactly, including case and truncation to the DICOM 16-character limit.
- If C-FIND works but retrieve fails, the first thing to check is usually the remote PACS destination table for the local AE.

- Measurement objects persist against the correct image geometry and are reprojected only onto compatible slices/views from the same acquisition space
- Series overview panel in the browser with persisted splitter sizing
- Progressive remote retrieval support inside the viewer, including status updates while images arrive
- Pseudonymization of imported studies

- Send-to-archive workflow for local studies

## Background

K-PACS was created around 2004 as a free DICOM workstation. It provided a full-featured PACS client including DICOM storage, query/retrieve, viewing, printing, CD burning, and modality worklist — capabilities that were typically only available in expensive commercial products at the time. It gained significant adoption worldwide, particularly in smaller imaging facilities and educational settings.

**K-PACS.neo** preserves the architectural concepts of the original while modernizing the codebase for the .NET platform with cross-platform support via Avalonia.
