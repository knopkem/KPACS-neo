# K-PACS.neo

A modern C# port of key components from **K-PACS**, the free DICOM workstation I originally wrote about 20 years ago. K-PACS was one of the first freely available DICOM viewers and became widely used in radiology departments, veterinary clinics, and research labs around the world.

This project aims to bring the core DICOM infrastructure into the .NET ecosystem, built on top of [fo-dicom](https://github.com/fo-dicom/fo-dicom) and targeting **.NET 10**.

The old **WPF viewer has been retired from this repository**. Active UI development now happens only in the **Avalonia** application.

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed: DCMClasses Core Library

The entire **DCMClasses** package has been ported — this is the foundational DICOM data layer that everything else builds on. It covers:

- **DICOM parsing & serialization** — reading/writing DICOM files, tag manipulation, sequence navigation, character set support
- **DICOM networking** — full async C-ECHO, C-FIND (Patient/Study/Series/Image level), C-MOVE, C-STORE SCU, and Modality Worklist queries
- **Image objects** — pixel data access, frame extraction, transfer syntax handling, compression/decompression
- **Specialized SOP classes** — Secondary Capture, Encapsulated PDF, Structured Reports, Presentation State (GSPS with annotations, windowing, spatial transforms)
- **DICOMDIR** — creation and reading of media directory structures
- **Utility functions** — UID generation, date/time conversions, patient name parsing, age calculation

### ✅ Completed: Avalonia Study Browser + Viewer (Cross-Platform)

The Avalonia application has moved beyond a single-file viewer and now includes a working **K-PACS-style local study browser** on top of the cross-platform viewer:

- **Database mode** backed by a local SQLite imagebox
- **Filesystem mode** with Windows-style `Computer` root, drive browsing, folder scan, and optional DICOMDIR usage
- **Network mode** with configured remote archive search, preview of remote series, and representative-image-first retrieval into the local imagebox
- **Preview-before-import workflow**: filesystem scans build preview studies first, and opening a study can copy it into the local imagebox in the background while it is already viewable
- **Study actions**: view, send to remote archive, pseudonymize, and delete study (including multi-select send/delete for local studies)
- **Background job monitor** for import/send tasks with progress, per-job logs, and optional DICOM communication trace inspection
- **Multi-window study viewing** with configurable 1-4 viewer windows, persisted placement per viewer, cross-window linked navigation, and a safety-first clear-all-open-viewers flow before opening a new study
- **Multi-viewport study viewer** with thumbnail strip, standard and custom layouts, double-click single-view focus toggle, LUT switching, stack-tool drag behavior, direct active-viewport selection, and drag-reassignable series layouting
- **Interactive orientation/navigation overlays** including patient left/right markers and a Shift-held transient 3D cursor for cross-view localization within the same viewer or across open viewers
- **Editable measurement tools** including pixel lens, line, angle, rectangular ROI, and polygon ROI, anchored to the referenced slice geometry in patient space
- **Volume-aware series viewing** for real volumetric CT/MR stacks with cached in-memory voxel volumes, axial/coronal/sagittal reslicing, and slab projection modes
- **In-panel volume interaction badges** shown only for true volume datasets: orientation switching, projection-mode switching, and drag-adjustable slab thickness in mm
- **Linked slice synchronization** for same-space series plus lightweight prior-study / CT-MR fallback registration based on cached voxel volumes
- **Key-image workflow** with K-PACS-root Secondary Capture generation, volume-mode key-image toggling, and preview-strip marking only for K-PACS-managed key-image series
- **DICOM rendering coverage** including bitmap overlay planes (60xx), embedded overlay bits, RGB Secondary Capture, and multiple YBR photometric interpretations
- **Search/filter support** in Database, Filesystem, and Network mode, including wildcard remote matching and safe blocking of empty remote queries
- **Local Storage SCP receiving** backed by fo-dicom with automatic import into the local imagebox
- **Operational polish** including toast notifications, persisted browser/viewer window placement, persisted study browser splitters, and non-modal viewer windows
- Shares the same platform-independent rendering engine and color LUTs across the current C# viewer stack
- Uses Avalonia pointer events, StorageProvider dialogs, and Semi.Avalonia styling

## Building

```bash
# Core library
dotnet build KPACS.DCMClasses/KPACS.DCMClasses.csproj

# Cross-platform Avalonia viewer
dotnet build KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia/KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia.csproj
```

## Release Packaging

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow at [.github/workflows/release-packages.yml](.github/workflows/release-packages.yml) that builds three native self-contained release artifacts for the Avalonia viewer:

- `win-x64` — single-file `.exe` packed as `.zip`
- `linux-x64` — single-file executable packed as `.tar.gz`
- `osx-arm64` — zipped `KPACS-neo.app` bundle for Apple Silicon Macs

These release builds use:

- self-contained .NET 10 runtime
- single-file publish
- embedded native libraries via self-extraction
- release symbols disabled for smaller artifacts

### Local publish commands

These are the exact publish settings used for release packaging:

```bash
dotnet publish KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia/KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:EnableCompressionInSingleFile=true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true -p:DebugType=None -p:DebugSymbols=false

dotnet publish KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia/KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia.csproj -c Release -r linux-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:EnableCompressionInSingleFile=true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true -p:DebugType=None -p:DebugSymbols=false

dotnet publish KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia/KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia.csproj -c Release -r osx-arm64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:EnableCompressionInSingleFile=true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true -p:DebugType=None -p:DebugSymbols=false
```

### GitHub Release flow

- Create a tag such as `v0.1.0`
- Publish a GitHub Release for that tag
- The workflow builds all three platform packages on native runners and attaches them to the release automatically

You can also run the workflow manually with `workflow_dispatch` to generate test artifacts without publishing a release.

### macOS note

The macOS package is emitted as an unsigned `.app` bundle. That is the most practical first-release shape for “download, unpack, start”, but Gatekeeper may still require the user to right-click the app and choose `Open` once unless the app is later code signed and notarized.

## Running

```bash
# Avalonia viewer (any platform)
dotnet run --project KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia/KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia.csproj
```

## Avalonia Browser Workflow

The Avalonia application now supports a practical local-plus-network K-PACS workflow:

- **Database** — studies already imported into the local SQLite imagebox
- **Filesystem** — browse drives/folders, scan DICOM folders or DICOMDIR media, preview studies, then import on demand
- **Filesystem** — browse drives/folders, scan DICOM folders or DICOMDIR media, preview studies, open them immediately, and let the local copy continue in the background
- **Network** — configure one primary remote archive, query studies, preview remote series, and open studies with progressive background retrieval into the local imagebox
- **Email** — placeholder tab for future mail/export workflows

### Local imagebox

The Avalonia application stores imported studies under the current user's local application data folder:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%/KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia/Imagebox
```

This contains:

- `imagebox.db` — SQLite metadata database
- `Studies/` — imported DICOM files organized by Study Instance UID / Series Instance UID

Additional runtime configuration files are stored alongside the imagebox root:

- `network-settings.json` — local AE title/port plus the configured remote archive
- `window-placement.json` — persisted browser/viewer geometry
- `study-browser-layout.json` — persisted patient/study and study/series splitter sizes
- `job-logs/` — per-job import/send logs written by the background job service

### Network workflow notes

- Double-clicking a network study loads remote series metadata first, then opens the viewer as soon as the first representative images arrive.
- Remaining series continue downloading in the background through the configured local Storage SCP.
- Local studies can be sent back to the configured archive with the `Send` action in Database mode.
- Empty network searches are blocked on purpose to avoid accidental full-archive C-FIND requests.

### Volume viewing notes

- Volume controls are shown only when a series could be promoted to a true in-memory volume; 2D datasets such as plain radiography, angiography, or ultrasound continue to use the legacy single-slice viewer path.
- The viewer loads the initial series through the existing file-based path first and upgrades matching series to cached voxel volumes in the background.
- The orientation badge inside the view panel switches between Axial, Coronal, and Sagittal.
- The projection badge inside the view panel switches between MPR, MipPR, MinPR, and MPVRT.
- Dragging on the projection badge changes slab thickness in millimeters; holding Shift while dragging enables finer adjustment.
- Linked navigation continues to use exact patient-space matching for compatible series and can fall back to a lightweight translation-only volume registration for prior studies or cross-modality comparisons when both sides have volumes.
- Open viewer windows for the same patient can broadcast linked navigation and Shift-based 3D cursor updates across monitors.

### Viewer interaction notes

- The layout popup supports both standard grids and custom row-based layouts such as `2:3` or `1,2`.
- Double-clicking a viewport toggles between the current layout and a focused single-view mode.
- Key-image preview badges are reserved for K-PACS-managed Secondary Capture series generated under the K-PACS UID root.
- Bitmap overlays from 60xx groups are rendered directly in the panel, with fallback extraction from embedded overlay bits when needed.

### Remote DICOM archive configuration examples

The Avalonia browser currently stores network configuration in `network-settings.json` under `%LOCALAPPDATA%/KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia`.

Example structure:

```json
{
    "LocalAeTitle": "KPACS",
    "LocalPort": 11112,
    "InboxDirectory": "C:\\Users\\<you>\\AppData\\Local\\KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia\\network-inbox",
    "SelectedArchiveId": "conquest-local",
    "Archives": [
        {
            "Id": "conquest-local",
            "Name": "Local Conquest",
            "Host": "127.0.0.1",
            "Port": 5678,
            "RemoteAeTitle": "CONQUESTSRV1"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Conquest PACS example

Use this when Conquest is running locally or on a reachable server and accepts query/retrieve on its configured TCP port.

```json
{
    "LocalAeTitle": "KPACS",
    "LocalPort": 11112,
    "InboxDirectory": "C:\\Users\\<you>\\AppData\\Local\\KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia\\network-inbox",
    "SelectedArchiveId": "conquest-main",
    "Archives": [
        {
            "Id": "conquest-main",
            "Name": "Conquest Main",
            "Host": "192.168.1.50",
            "Port": 5678,
            "RemoteAeTitle": "CONQUESTSRV1"
        }
    ]
}
```

Typical Conquest pairing:

- Local Storage SCP in K-PACS: AE `KPACS`, port `11112`
- Remote archive in K-PACS: host `192.168.1.50`, port `5678`, remote AE `CONQUESTSRV1`
- Matching destination configured in Conquest for C-MOVE/C-STORE back to K-PACS: AE `KPACS` at your workstation IP and port `11112`

#### Orthanc example

Orthanc often uses AE title `ORTHANC` and DICOM port `4242` unless changed in its configuration.

```json
{
    "LocalAeTitle": "KPACS",
    "LocalPort": 11112,
    "InboxDirectory": "C:\\Users\\<you>\\AppData\\Local\\KPACS.Viewer.Avalonia\\network-inbox",
    "SelectedArchiveId": "orthanc-dev",
    "Archives": [
        {
            "Id": "orthanc-dev",
            "Name": "Orthanc Dev",
            "Host": "127.0.0.1",
            "Port": 4242,
            "RemoteAeTitle": "ORTHANC"
        }
    ]
}
```

Checklist for any remote PACS:

- The remote PACS must know the workstation as destination AE `KPACS` on port `11112` (or whatever you configure locally).
- Firewalls must allow inbound traffic to the local Storage SCP port.
- AE titles must match exactly, including case and truncation to the DICOM 16-character limit.
- If C-FIND works but retrieve fails, the first thing to check is usually the remote PACS destination table for the local AE.

### Current viewer capabilities

- Window/level, zoom, pan, fit-to-window, and color LUT switching
- Stack tool with accelerated drag scrolling for series browsing
- Click-to-activate viewports inside the study viewer
- Thumbnail strip for jumping between series and drag-dropping series into arbitrary viewports
- Patient orientation markers on the viewer overlay for left/right validation
- Shift-held 3D cursor that projects the hovered location into compatible views without locking the viewer in localization mode
- Measurement mode selector with editable line, angle, rectangular ROI, polygon ROI, and pixel lens tools
- Measurement objects persist against the correct image geometry and are reprojected only onto compatible slices/views from the same acquisition space
- Series overview panel in the browser with persisted splitter sizing
- Progressive remote retrieval support inside the viewer, including status updates while images arrive
- Pseudonymization of imported studies
- Delete-study workflow that removes both database rows and stored files
- Send-to-archive workflow for local studies

## Background

K-PACS was created around 2004 as a free DICOM workstation. It provided a full-featured PACS client including DICOM storage, query/retrieve, viewing, printing, CD burning, and modality worklist — capabilities that were typically only available in expensive commercial products at the time. It gained significant adoption worldwide, particularly in smaller imaging facilities and educational settings.

**K-PACS.neo** preserves the architectural concepts of the original while modernizing the codebase for the .NET platform with cross-platform support via Avalonia.
